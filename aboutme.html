              <p> Hey there! My name is Manee and I'm a freshman at URI, majoring in Computer Science.<br>
                 I like to draw and spend time with my loved ones. Over the summer I went to Disney World with my family.<br>
                 We went on a few rides and stayed up late to watch some fireworks. My favorite ride was the new Guardian's of the Galaxy coaster.<br>
                 Also I like to cosplay with my best friend. We attended FanExpo comic con together as characters from Good Omens.
